# Print the Bridges in the graph
Bridge is the edge, which when removed increases the number of components of the graph

## Steps:
* Create time of insertion array, lowest time array and visited array
* Traverse the graph using dfs, dont traverse for parent node, as it will push you backward
* Increase time of insertion and lowest time while traversing
* when dfs is complete for any node, update the low of the node with its adjacent node, if smaller
* then check the condition  ```if(low[it]>tin[node])```, if this fulfills then there is a bridge
* else if the node is already visited, then update the low of node
