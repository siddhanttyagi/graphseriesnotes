# Minimum Spanning tree
* When a graph is converted into a tree such that it contains all the n nodes and only n-1 edges connecting all the nodes such that every node is reachable from every other node and the cost of that tree is minimal then that is known as the minimum spanning tree or MST
* For a graph there can be multiple spanning tree.

Now let us see the MST of one more graph:

Now how do we find the MST from a graph, so there are couple of algorithms to find out the MST:
* Prims Algorithm
* Kruskal's Algorithm
