# Shortest Path in Undirected Graph with Unit Weights

As we can see that the graph is undirected as well and unweighted, so whenever the graph is undirected as well as unweighted, we assume that all the edges are weighted as 1.

Now we will be given a source, and we have to find the shortest path from source to all nodes, let us assume that source is 0th vertex for now, we'll find the shortest path using BFS, for that we'll have a queue for traversing all vertices and it's adjacent nodes and we'll have a distance array initialized with infinity, considering the initial distance of all the nodes from source to be infinity.

 * Create a distance array which will store the shortest path from source to all vertices
 * Initialize all the elements of the distance array with infinity
 * Assign the dist of source element as 0, because distance between source and source is always zero
 * create a queue
 * Push the source node into queue
 * Traverse while queue will become empty
     * Take out the node from queue
     * traverse all it's adjacent nodes
     * if the distance already stored in that node i.e dis[node] + 1 is smaller than the dis

```C++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void shortest_path(int v, int src, vector<int> adj[]){
    //create a distance array and initialize it with infinity
    int dis[v];
    for(int i=0; i<v; i++){
        dis[i] = INT_MAX;
    }
    
    //distance of source from the source will be zero
    
    dis[src] = 0;
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(src);
    
    //update if path is smaller
    while(!q.empty()){
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for(auto it : adj[node]){
            if((dis[node] + 1)<dis[it]){
                dis[it] = dis[node]+1;
                q.push(it);
            }
        }
    }
    //print result
    for(int i=0; i<v; i++) cout<<dis[i]<<" ";
}
int main(){
    int n, m;
    cin>>n>>m;
    
    vector<int> adj[n];
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
        int u, v;
        cin>>u>>v;
        
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }
    
    shortest_path(n, adj);
    return 0;
}
```
