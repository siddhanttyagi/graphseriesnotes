# Articualtion Point
Articulation point is the node of the graph, on whose removal the graph gets divides into two or more than two components

*Below is our graph*:

# 1.*Let us remove any node*

It will look something like this:

If we remove this part, does graph gets divided into two or more than two components, answer is NO, therefore this is not an ariculation point

# 2.*Let us remove some other node*

It will look something like this:

We can see that the graph gets divided into two components, therefore this is an articulation point

# 3.*Similarly we can see that 8 is also an articulation point:*

# Steps to find articulation point:
* Similar to that of the finding bridges in prev question
* we'll use the same formula, the difference isjust that ```if((low[it] >= tin[node]) && parent != -1)```
